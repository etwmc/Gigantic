Due to its nature, a wearable device can either provide limited functions, or disappointing battery life. However, the battery of a functional wearable device is not drain by carrying out functions, but by the display module, and the graphic function used to maintain a Graphic User Interface (GUI). Therefore, by changing the way we interact with wearable devices, we could balance between functionality and power consumption. 
This project is a voice command-orientated interface specialized for the calculation and limitation of wearable device. 

Because the time constraints, the introduction is not ready yet. Please reference to the PDF on any details of the project.
